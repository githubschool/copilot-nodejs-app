Each test should be completely independent of all other tests.
Add a short description above each test explaining its reason and goal.

Each test should have 3 sections labeled with a comment for Arrange, Act, and Assert.
The 'Arrange' section should contain all preperation before running the test.
The 'Act' section should call the method being tested.
The 'Assert' sections should retrieve results and check them.
